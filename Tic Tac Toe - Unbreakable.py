Made this as the board for the tic tac toe game, decided to go with a fully enclosed board as it looks most aesthetic imo.
As can be seen, the the index for each postion are placed inside the print of the board, made the whole thing alot less tricky as opposed to using strings
only to be followed by the replace method.
